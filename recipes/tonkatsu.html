        <h3>Garnish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>shredded cabbage</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make 3-4 tiny slits on the connection tissue between the meat and fat and without cutting through meat.
            </li>
            <li>Pound the meat into thin and an even thickness (about ¼ inch each). Season with salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Prepare 3 large bowls.
                1st bowl. Add beaten egg
                2nd bowl. Add flour
                3rd bowl. Panko breadcrumb</li>
            <li>Dredge the meat into the flour, shake excess flour and then dip it into the beaten egg, shake excess.
                Dredge in panko, then cover the meat evenly with panko breadcrumbs by patting with your hands to make
                the meat is throughly covered. Turn it over and repeat. Shake off excess crumbs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking Option 1: Deep Fry</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat at least 1 ½ inches oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F on medium-high heat.
                Dip a chopstick into the oil. If the oil starts steadily bubbling, then the oil is hot enough for
                frying. </li>
            <li>Working in batches, deep fry the cutlet (one at the time) until golden on the bottom for about 3 minutes
                (more or less cooking time depending on the thickness of the cut).
                Flip and cook for 2-3 minutes (more or less cooking time depending on the thickness of the cut).
                Transfer pork to a paper-towel-lined platter to drain.
                The minimum cooking time is determined by the thickness of the cut. The safe internal pork cooking
                temperature for fresh cuts is 145° F.
                Serve with Tonkatsu sauce and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
