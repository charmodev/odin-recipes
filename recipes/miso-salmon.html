        <h1>Miso Salmon</h1>
        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>A dish made by marinating salmon in a mixture of miso paste, soy sauce, sake, and sugar before grilling or
            broiling it</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skin-on salmon fillets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp miso</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy saucee</li>
            <li>¼ tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Garnish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ tsp toasted white and black sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Make sure that your salmon fillets don't have scales and tiny bones. Run your fingers back and forth
                across
                the skin to see if any scales are left. To remove them, use the flat side of a knife and scrape against
                the
                scales. To check if there are any bones, run your fingers along the flesh surface and the sides. You
                will
                feel the hard tips of the bones poke your skin. Use fish boning tweezers to pull them out. I recommend
                slicing the salmon fillet in half so it marinates and cooks faster.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a large bowl or flat tray.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon in the bowl, skin side up. Spoon the marinade on top and coat the salmon skin. Cover
                and
                keep it in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours (a thicker cut needs more time). This is a lightly seasoned
                miso
                fish (not miso-marinated fish like Black Cod), so I don’t recommend marinating the salmon overnight
                since
                miso is quite salty.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (218ºC) with a rack placed in the center position. For a convection oven,
                reduce
                the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). As miso burns easily, remove any excess marinade completely from
                the
                salmon.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon pieces skin side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you're using an
                oven
                probe, insert it into the thickest part of the salmon flesh.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To Bake the Salmon</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and attach the probe to the oven. Bake the salmon (no need to flip
                it)
                until an internal temperature of 125-130°F* (52-54ºC) is registered at the thickest part of the fillet,
                for
                roughly 18-20 minutes. If you don't have a probe, I highly recommend getting a Thermapen instant-read
                thermometer. If you don't use a thermometer, our recommended baking time is 5 minutes per ½-inch (1.3
                cm)
                thickness of salmon (measured at the thickest). *If you prefer medium rare, you can stop cooking at
                120ºF
                (49ºC). *The USDA recommends cooking fish to an internal temperature of 145°F (63ºC); however, the
                remaining
                heat will continue to cook the salmon, resulting in well-overcooked fish.</li>
            <li>This step is optional. To give a nice char on the salmon, we will broil the salmon. Remove the probe
                from
                the salmon and oven. Change the oven setting to broil high (550ºF/288ºC), but keep the oven rack placed
                in
                the center position, 9 inches* (23 cm) away from the top heating element. Broil the salmon on high for 3
                minutes or until the surface is blistered and browned a bit. *When broiling, you don't control the
                temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the heating element and the surface
                of
                the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill.</li>
            <li>I always discard the marinade (that's why I try to use the least amount of condiments), but if you don't
                want to waste it or made too much, you can dilute the marinade with water and cook it for a few minutes.
                Serve it with the salmon or use it for other dishes.</li>
